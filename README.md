# Multiclass Nuts Classification using custom CNN and Transfer learning

This project focuses on image classification of different types of nuts using deep learning.

The goal is to train models, then choosing a best model that can correctly identify nut categories from images. Here, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) & ResNet50 model.
The entire pipeline - including preprocessing, training, validation, evaluation, and inference was implemented in Google Colab.

**Dataset Used**

The dataset is publicly available on Mendeley:
-	**Dataset link:** https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fmrnybgxb9/1
-	**Total Images**- 1742
-	**Total Class**- Total 10 classes ( Almond, Brazil Nuts, Cashew, Hazelnuts, Macademia, Peanut, Pistachio, Thai Peanut, Vietnamian Cashew, Walnuts)

**Features of This Project**
-	Data preprocessing & augmentation
-	CNN & ResNet50 model training
-	Model evaluation
-	Saving best model checkpoint
-	Running inference - predicting nuts type from new images
-	Sample input and output included for quick testing
